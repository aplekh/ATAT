# ATAT

The Adipose Tissue Analysis Toolkit (ATAT) is a plugin for the open-source image analysis software ImageJ. ATAT performs analysis of adipocyte size and WAT fibrosis.

ATAT employs both local and image-level differentials in pixel intensity to threshold background independently of adipocyte-free tissue without user input. It captures adipocytes in histological sections stained with common histological dyes and performs automated analysis of adipocyte cross-sectional area, total fibrosis, and region of interest (ROI)-assisted pericellular or perilobular fibrosis; it is also capable of identifying and measuring adipocytes in bone marrow adipose tissue. ATAT enables fully automated analysis of batches of histological images using either default or user-defined adipocyte detection parameters.

ATAT offers distinct advantages over current WAT image analysis tools in that it allows high-throughput analyses of adipocyte-specific parameters as well as fibrotic regions associated with individual adipocytes. It also enables the assessment of fibrotic changes associated with WAT remodeling due to weight gain and loss, tumor invasion, and other pathophysiological changes that affect WAT function.

## Downloading ATAT

Please download ATAT from [Releases](https://github.com/aplekh/ATAT/releases) on this GitHub page. The latest release can be found [Here](https://github.com/aplekh/ATAT/releases/tag/v1.1.24).

If you already have an older version of ATAT downloaded, please remove it from your ImageJ directory prior to installing a new one.
